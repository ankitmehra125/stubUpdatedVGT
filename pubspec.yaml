# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - Assets/
    - Assets/ORGANISER_APP/Icons/Orders/
    - Assets/ORGANISER_APP/Images/HomeFeed/
    - Assets/ORGANISER_APP/Icons/Dashboard/
    - Assets/ORGANISER_APP/Images/O_Profile/
    - Assets/Videos/
    - Assets/Emoji/
    - Assets/Images/OnBoarding/
    - Assets/Images/Components/
    - Assets/Images/Components/Payment/
    - Assets/Images/Components/Flags/
    - Assets/Images/Components/Profile/
    - Assets/Images/Components/TemoraryComponents/
    - Assets/Images/
    - Assets/epic/
    - Assets/Images/Icon/

    - Assets/Images/Components/BottomNavigationBar/
    - Assets/ORGANISER_APP/Images/OrgDashBoardImages/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: SatoshiRegular
       fonts:
         - asset: Assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Regular.otf
     - family: SatoshiLight
       fonts:
         - asset: Assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Light.otf
     - family: SatoshiMedium
       fonts:
         - asset: Assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Medium.otf
     - family: SatoshiBold
       fonts:
         - asset: Assets/Fonts/Satoshi-Bold.otf
